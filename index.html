        <h3 class="lb_heading">Ed Hardy</h3>
        <p class="lb_text">
          Hardy was mentored by several famous and prolific tattoo artists,
          including Samuel Steward (also known by his nickname “Professor” Phil
          Sparrow), a former college professor. As a child, Hardy had copied
          Steward's designs. Steward showed Hardy a book of Japanese tattoos
          Hardy, who had already been interested in Japanese history, culture
          and woodblock prints, had an epiphany; he described it as being struck
          by “lightning.” After Hardy finished his apprenticeship with Steward,
          he studied with the tattoo artists Zeke Owen in Seattle and Doc Webb
          in San Diego.
        </p>
        <p class="lb_text">
          Eventually Hardy formed a relationship with one of the pioneers of
          modern tattoo culture, Sailor Jerry Collins, who had a major impact on
          Hardy's work. He met with and began a long correspondence with Sailor
          Jerry, which paved the way for an introduction into a world previously
          closed off to outsiders. Through Jerry’s connections, Hardy began an
          association, in 1973, with the classical tattoo master Horihide. Hardy
          studied and tattooed in Japan off and on through the '70s and '80s.
          According to Hardy, his clientele at the time included bikers and
          Yakuza members.

        <h3 class="lb_heading">Sailor Jerry</h3>
        <p class="lb_text">
          Sailor Jerry's influence on the art of modern tattooing is widely
          recognized.
        </p>
        <p class="lb_text">
          Sailor Jerry wanted at least one of three protégés/friends – Ed Hardy,
          Mike Malone, or Zeke Owen – to take over his shop (or else burn it)
          when he died. Since 2015, an annual independently produced event now
          takes place in Hawaii every June called the Sailor Jerry Festival to
          honor Collins's legacy and Chinatown roots on Oahu. The multi-venue
          event includes live music, DJs, cabaret performances, and an art show
          (featured artists have included Sailor Jerry's great-grand niece
          Madison Thomas, local artists, and Masami Teraoka), movie screenings,
          a pin-up fashion show (where models wear outfits designed from Sailor
          Jerry flash), neighborhood tours, and tattoos available at three area
          shops (including Sailor Jerry's last location).[9] A portion of the
          proceeds from the event is donated every year to the Collins family by
          the festival founder (Jason Miller of 808shows.com/Hawaiian Express
          Records) and his co-host (Josh86, a popular musician and
          entrepreneur).

        <h3 class="lb_heading">Horihide</h3>
        <p class="lb_text">
          Horihide is one of the most famous, still alive Japanese tattoo
          masters, who made Japanese tattoo famous in other countries. As young
          tattooist Horihide was amazed by colors of tattoo of American
          servicemen who he met in Japan in 60tees. He learned that they had
          been tattooed by Sailor Jerry (Norman Keith Collins – prominent
          American tattoo artist, famous for his tattooing of sailors (January
          14, 1911 – June 12, 1973), and so he began corresponding with Jerry
          for several years.
        </p>
        <p class="lb_text">
          Horihide was also one of few tattooists who learned English at that
          time. After four years of corresponding they finally met, exchanging
          American color inks for Japanese tattoo motifs. Horihide became
          teacher and main source of information for Don Ed Hardy, student of
          Sailor Jerry. When Ed Hardy arrive to Japan in 1973 to study Japanese
          style, he did not know that he become recognized for incorporating
          Japanese tattoo aesthetics and technique into his American style work.

        <h3 class="lb_heading">Horiyoshi III</h3>
        <p class="lb_text">
          Nakano was inspired when he saw a Yakuza (Japanese gangster) with a
          full-body tattoo in a public bathhouse when he was a young boy, "about
          eleven or twelve." This inspired him to visit legendary tattoo artist
          Yoshitsugu Muramatsu, also known as Shodai Horiyoshi of Yokohama.
          Nakano got his own tattoo from Horiyoshi II—Shodai Horiyoshi's son—and
          lead to Nakano becoming Horiyoshi I's apprentice at age 25.
        </p>
        <p class="lb_text">
          Horiyoshi III is the second tattooist to be granted that honorific
          title, which passes from master to apprentice. The tattooist
          affixation Hori means to engrave or "to carve." Muramatsu bestowed
          this title upon Nakano in 1971.

        <h3 class="lb_heading">Leo Zulueta</h3>
        <p class="lb_text">
          During the 1970s he began to explore his interest in Bornean
          traditional tattooing. In 1976 he met tattoo artist Don Ed Hardy, who
          encouraged him to become a tattooist. Zulueta started tattooing
          professionally in 1981.
        </p>
        <p class="lb_text">
          Zulueta's style of neo-tribal tattooing has been influential to other
          tattoo artists. In 1989, he was featured in the RE/Search publication
          Modern Primitives. In 1992, Zulueta founded Black Wave Tattoo in Los
          Angeles, California, which he sold in 2000. In 2007, he was featured
          on TLC's Tattoo Wars with his protégé Rory Keating. Zulueta currently
          resides in Ann Arbor, Michigan, where he operates Spiral Tattoo.

        <h3 class="lb_heading">Lyle Tuttle</h3>
        <p class="lb_text">
          In 1949, Lyle Tuttle began tattooing professionally. In 1954 he opened
          his own studio in San Francisco; this first shop was open for 35
          years. Tuttle tattooed Janis Joplin, Cher, Jo Baker, the Allman
          Brothers, Peter Fonda, and Paul Stanley, among others.
        </p>
        <p class="lb_text">
          He did work on all seven continents, was tattooed on six continents,
          and never knowingly tattooed a minor. His fame within the U.S. tattoo
          world was somewhat controversial, as many tattooists of his day
          disliked his statements to the press and "shameless self-promotion".
          When Tuttle was on the cover of Rolling Stone magazine in October
          1970, Sailor Jerry put the picture inside his toilet.
